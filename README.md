ðŸ§  Virtual Memory Management Simulator (Java Swing GUI)
This Java-based simulator provides an interactive and visual representation of virtual memory management techniques, focusing on page replacement algorithms. Implemented with Java Swing, the application supports:

ðŸ“¦ Page Replacement Algorithms: FIFO, LRU, MRU, and Optimal

ðŸ”„ Step-by-step animation of page hits and faults

ðŸ“Š Real-time visualization of memory frames

ðŸ“‹ Explanation panel to describe each step of execution

ðŸ“ˆ Summary statistics: page faults, total pages, hit ratio

Useful for students and learners looking to understand how different memory management algorithms work in an OS.
